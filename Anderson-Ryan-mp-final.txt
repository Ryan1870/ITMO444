run the lunch launch.sh shell twice. the first will set up the DB

Give it some time for the DB to start up, and run the script again so the db schema can be built

I have 1 repo all the files are located in that repo. Easier to maintain than 3. 

Added logic for sns to submit.php in the messy if else logic, sends to email, easier for testing

I am not a front developer so my css templates just change the background color.
